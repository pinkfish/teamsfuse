Heatmap rendering
=========================
As of version 2.1.0 we have added new features for rendering heatmaps.
Heatmaps make it easy for viewers to understand the distribution and relative
intensity of data points on a map. Rather than placing a marker at each
location, heatmaps use color to represent the distribution of the data.

In the example below, red represents areas of high concentration of police
stations in Victoria, Australia.
